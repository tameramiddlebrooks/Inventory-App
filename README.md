# Know Your Inventory

**Description**: Know Your Inventory is a React application built for providing users an easy way to keep track of inventory of various items. The app also includes a "Daily Quotes" Page created using the Type Fit Quotes API (https://type.fit/api/quotes this API does not have official documentation.)

**Built With**: Know Your Inventory was Built using JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and the React library.

**Challenges Faced**: My biggest challenge when building this project was deciding on a method the user will use to update their Inventory. There were multiple ways to go about doing this and I struggled with picking my direction and sticking to it. My inital idea was to create cards containing the inventory item where users can use increment/decrement buttons to increase and decrease how much of that item they had in stock. I ran into some issues when doing this because of the method I've learned to create cards was not compatible with this idea. I shuffled through a few more ideas before finally landing on the creation of a form where users type in their item and the item quantity, and then go to view the changes in their console.

**Miniumum Need To Have Features**: The minumum need to have features for this project is the ability for users to seamlessly add Items to their Inventory and update the quantity, as well as the ability to send an email when an item quantity reaches 0. Also, users being able to use the Daily Quotes Page for daily wisdom is another necessary feature.

**Post-MVP**: As my coding knowledge and experience grows, I think in the future I would like to implement my initial idea of an increment and decriment button for users to utilize. While the app is currently functional and easy to use, I feel that successful ideas could always be improved upon in the future when more skill has been acquired.

**How to Use**: Know Your Inventory has been deployed using Netlify. Users can click on the Netlify link in the description to access the application.
When the user opens the application, they will be greeted with the Navigation Bar.

From there, they can choose to view the Inventory Page, the About Page, the Daily Quotes Page, or the Contact Page. When a user accesses the Inventory Page, they will be able to use the form to update their inventory. When an item in their inventory is successfully updated, they will be able to view the changes in their console. Here's an example of what this will look like.

Users will also be able to use the Contact Page to send an email when an item in their inventory has reached 0. Here's an example of what this will look like.

**Dependencies**: Prerequisites for emulating this project include Windows 10, Git Bash, and a code editor (I used Visual Studio Code). A source that was especially helpful to me was this Youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgWGllOjkbs) explaining how to use EmailJs, which I used for my Contact Page.
